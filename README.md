###### All tools are activated via the keyboard.

1. Navigate Next/Previous links in any page using ▶ and ◀ keys.
  - This works by searching for links with the text 'Next', 'Prev' or 'Previous'.
  - It won't fire when within a textarea or input element. 
  
2. Change any page's width using <b>'Ctrl Shift -'</b> (decrease), <b>'Ctrl Shift +'</b> (increase), and <b>'Ctrl Shift 0'</b> (reset).
  - This is especially useful when reading books online. On bigger screens the text can stretch across the entire page making it difficult to read. 
  - It works by modifying the base html element and so is prone to errors if the page being viewed has a styled html element.
  - It is persistent. It remembers the last width you set for any domain and will automatically reset the page to that width when you revisit it.
  
3. Convert a page with a dark unreadable background to a light background using <b>'Ctrl  i'</b>
  - This works by injecting a new css file into any page thus forcing a lighter background.
  - This is also persistent.
  - To reset, hit <b>'Ctrl  i'</b> again.
